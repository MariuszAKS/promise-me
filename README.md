# Promise Me

An app created:
- with Vite
- in React
- using TypeScript

## What will it do

The app is going to allow the user creation of Promises.

They are objects that contain a promise, that the user makes to himself.

#### Examples:
- stop smoking
- exercise every day
- learn something new every week

#### Promise will contain:
- question (that user is asked)
- how often is it asked
- creation date
- dates when it was kept
- current and max streaks

It's supposed to aid in creation of positive habits

## Deadline

App is supposed to be finished before the end of November 2024
